			<p>The <strong>Open Source Exchange Rates API</strong> project was designed to address a glaring problem with exchange rate data on the internet: there's an untold number of free <em>currency conversion services</em>, but no free/reliable place for developers to access the rates that power them.</p>

			<p>Originally built to integrate seamlessly with <a href="http://josscrowcroft.github.com/money.js/" title="money.js - tiny (1kb) javascript library for real-time currency conversion" target="_blank">money.js</a>, the API provides up-to-date, flexible and portable currency conversion data that can be used in any application, framework or language (not just JavaScript).</p>

			<!-- Introduction -->

			<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

			<p><em>&ldquo;They want <strong>how much</strong> for their exchange-rates API?!&rdquo;</em></p>

			<p>APIs do exist, but they either cost between $20 and $500 per month for access, or the data is buried in an horrendous mess of unusable XML. Until now, there was no central place where exchange rates could be reliably sourced, for free, with no usage limits.</p>

			<p>The &lsquo;API&rsquo; is powered by a simple nodeJS scraper and GitHub. Every hour, <a href="http://currencybot.github.com" title="Currency Bot" target="_blank">Currency Bot</a> collects all the exchange rates from various reliable providers with public-facing APIs, then pushes them in <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> format to a public GitHub code repository for everybody to use.</p>
			<p>The rates are available historically for any day since the project started, and could soon be extended to provide data going back several years.</p>
			<p>All rates are relative to USD (currently) - you only need the conversion rates relative to any single currency in order to compute the rate between any other two currencies - see the documentation for more.</p>

			<p>The code and data are available at <a href="http://github.com/currencybot/open-exchange-rates" title="currencybot/open-exchange-rates github api">currencybot/open-exchange-rates</a>, and mirrored with friendly <code>Access-Control</code> HTTP headers and optional <acronym title="JSON with Padding">JSONP</acronym> support (for cross-domain/<acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX">AJAX</acronym> requests) on the free proxy at <a href="http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json" title="openexchangerates.org API proxy service" target="_blank">openexchangerates.org</a>.</p>

			<p>You can also access a list of available currencies with their full names:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">{
	"AED": "United Arab Emirates Dirham",
	"ALL": "Albanian Lek",
	"ANG": "Neth Antilles Guilder",

	/* see [<a href="https://raw.github.com/currencybot/open-exchange-rates/master/currencies.json" title="open exchange rates project - available currencies" target="_blank">currencies.json</a>] for the full list */</pre>



			<h4>Accessing the API (available URLs)</h4>

			<p>The Open Source Exchange Rates API is available on GitHub (via the direct 'raw' link to the JSON data files) and also available via a proxy (with friendly <code>Access-Control</code> headers and JSONP support, for cross-domain/<acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX">AJAX</acronym> requests) at openexchangerates.org.</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://raw.github.com/currencybot/open-exchange-rates/master/latest.json" title="latest exchange rates json">latest.json</a> file always contains the most up-to-date exchange rates:</p>
			<pre>https://raw.github.com/currencybot/open-exchange-rates/master/latest.json</pre>
			<p>For <strong>AJAX / cross-domain requests</strong> in JavaScript, the raw links will not work in many situations, because GitHub doesn't send the appropriate headers for cross-origin resource sharing (in most browsers you will see an error saying "Origin [yourdomain] is not allowed by..." - so you can also access the API via the proxy at <a href="http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json" title="openexchangerates.org API proxy service">openexchangerates.org</a></code>:</p>
			<pre>http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json
http://openexchangerates.org/currencies.json
http://openexchangerates.org/historical/2011-10-18.json</pre>

			<p>The openexchangerates.org proxy also supports <strong><acronym title="JSON with Padding">JSONP</acronym> requests</strong>, if you're into that kinda thing. Just append <code>?callback=<em>[someFunction]</em></code> to any valid URL, and the data will be returned wrapped in the callback function you specify, as long as it's a valid method name:</p>

			<pre>http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json<strong>?callback=<em>myCallback</em></strong></pre>



			<h4>Historical Data</h4>

			<p>Historical exchange rate data are available for every day* since 1991 (thanks to an epic 400,000-line pull request!)</p>
			<p>You can access historical data snapshots, where available, in the format &lsquo;<code><strong>historical/<em>yyyy-mm-dd</em>.json</strong></code>&rsquo; (for example: <a href="https://raw.github.com/currencybot/open-exchange-rates/master/historical/2011-10-09.json" title="Historical exhange rate data">historical/2011-10-09.json</a>.) They're also available via the openexchangerates.org proxy service (see URLs, above).</p>
			<p>You can browse <a href="https://github.com/currencybot/open-exchange-rates/tree/master/historical" title="historical exchange rate data">available dates</a> in the repository, although there's currently close to 4,000 files in that one directory, so listing it may take a long time (they might be sorted into directories by year soon.) To access the raw data, click any file and then click 'raw' in the top right-hand corner.</p>
			<p>The repository will soon include an index file (possibly 'available.json') which you can hit up, to find out which dates are available in an application.</p>
			<p><small><em>* You can delve down further and access the hourly data for every day since the project started by looking at the file revisions for each of the historical daily files, or by cloning the git repository and checking out the commit messages. If you <strong>really</strong> wanted to, that is.</em></small></p>



			<h4>Specification / Properties</h4>

			<p>The API is delivered in <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> format. Here's a description of every property in the JSON object:</p>


			<h5>disclaimer</h5>

			<p>A reminder to anybody using/viewing the API data (possibly out-of-context) that its accuracy and availability are never guaranteed, and that there's no warranty provided. I'm open to rewriting this if anybody has suggestions on what to include (I'm no legal boffin!)</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">"disclaimer": "This data is collected from various providers and provided free of charge for informational purposes only, with no guarantee whatsoever of accuracy, validity, availability or fitness for any purpose; use at your own risk. Other than that - have fun, and please share/watch/fork if you think data like this should be free!"</pre>


			<h5>license</h5>

			<p>Similar to the <code>disclaimer</code>, if people see this API out-of-context, it's important that they realise it's free and open source:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">"license": "all code open-source under GPL v3 [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0]. all data made available by various providers; copyright may apply; not for resale; no warranties given."</pre>


			<h5>timestamp</h5>

			<p>The <code>timestamp</code> (UNIX time) is given so that users/developers can check when this data was gathered. This could be useful for determining whether the file is up-to-date or providing an <em>&ldquo;Exchange Rates collected on: [date]&rdquo;</em> message, and is especially handy when accessing historical data.</p>
			<p>NB: If you're using the <code>timestamp</code> value in JavaScript, remember to multiply it by 1000 as JavaScript uses time in milliseconds instead of seconds.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">"timestamp": 1318326416</pre>


			<h5>base</h5>

			<p>The base currency to which all the exchange rates are relative. This currency is also given in the <code>rates</code> object (e.g. <code>"USD" : 1</code>). Knowing the base currency for the exchange rates, it's possible to compute the rate between any other two currencies.</p>
			<p>NB: <code>base</code> is always <code>"USD"</code>, at least for now, but it's good practice to double-check.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">"base": "USD"</pre>


			<h5>rates</h5>

			<p>The object containing all the conversion rates for all of the available currencies, labeled by their international-standard 3-letter currency codes.</p>
			<p>All the values in <code>rates</code> are relative to the <code>base</code> currency (e.g. <code>1 USD : AED 3.67</code>), and the <code>base</code> currency is included (e.g. <code>"USD": 1</code>). It's possible to compute the rate between any of the currencies by taking into account the <code>base</code> rate; see the <a href="#documentation" title="open source exchange rates documentation">documentation</a> for more on this.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">"rates": {
	"AED": 3.67290571,
	"ANG": 1.75999944,
	// etc...</pre>
			<p>You can use <a href="https://raw.github.com/currencybot/open-exchange-rates/master/currencies.json" title="open exchange rates project - available currencies" target="_blank">currencies.json</a> for a JSON-formatted mapping between the three-letter currency codes and the full currency names.</p>

			<h4 id="how-to-use">Currency Conversion 101: how to use the exchange rates</h4>

			<p>An exchange rate (a.k.a. foreign-exchange / forex / FX rate) between two currencies is the rate at which one currency may be exchanged for (or buy) another. Exchange rates change frequently (except on weekends) because currencies are traded on open markets, just like public companies.</p>
			<p>Exchange rates are often quoted as a <em>currency pair</em>, which is the quotation of the <em>number of units of one currency that can be exchanged for a single unit of another currency</em>. For example, "1 Euro in US dollars" would be expressed as: <code>EUR/USD 1.2945</code>, where USD is the 'quote currency' (price currency / payment currency) and EUR is the 'base currency' (unit currency / transaction currency).</p>
			
			<h5>All rates relative to USD</h5>
			<p>For consistency, all the rates in the Open Exchange Rates data are given relative to US Dollars, meaning that <code>USD</code> is always the 'base' currency (although there are a number of internationally-accepted currency pairs, such as <code>EUD/USD</code>, in which USD is the 'quote' currency.)</p>
			<p>Therefore the value in <code>fx.rates</code> for British Pounds of <code>GBP: 0.6438</code> implies a currency pair of <code>USD/GBP 0.6438</code>, whereby "1 US Dollar buys 0.6438 British Pounds".</p>
			
			<h5>Inverse exchange rates</h5>
			<p>If you have the rate between a 'base' and a 'quote' currency, you can simply <em>invert</em> the ratio (i.e. <code>1/x</code>) to find the reverse transactional value, so that <code>USD/AED 3.6731</code> (or <em>1 US Dollar to 3.6731 Dirhams</em>), inverted, becomes <code>AED/USD 0.2722</code> (or <em>1 Dirham to 0.2722 US Dollars</em>).</p>

			<h5>Cross-pairs: Finding the rate between any two currencies, relative to USD</h5>
			<p>Given that we know all of the exchange rates relative to a 'base' currency (USD), we can easily calculate the rate between any of the 'quote' currencies given in <code>fx.rates</code> by multiplying the rates together as below.</p>
			<p>For example, if you need to convert British Pounds (GBP) to Hong Kong Dollars (HKD), the calculation is equal to converting the GBP to USD first, <em>then</em> converting those USD to HKD - but we can do this in a single step.</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">// let usd_gbp = 0.6438, usd_hkd = 7.7668
gbp_hkd = usd_hkd * (1 / usd_gbp)</pre>
			<p>In other words, if you have the following exchange rates relative to US Dollars (the common 'base'): <code>USD/GBP 0.6438</code> and <code>USD/HKD 7.7668</code>, then you can calculate <code>GBP/HKD 12.0639</code> by multiplying 7.7668 by the inverse of 0.6438, or <code>7.7668 * (1 / 0.6438)</code>.</p>
			
			<h5>Go forth and multiply (currencies)</h5>
			<p>That's the quickest run-down I could muster, but if there are any economists or mathematicians who want to offer a better explanation, please <a href="http://twitter.com/josscrowcroft" title="Joss Crowcroft on Twitter">get in touch</a> and let me know. I'm no professor and I'd love to get some improvements!</p>
			<p>Incidentally, if you're working in JavaScript, <a href="http://josscrowcroft.github.com/money.js/" title="money.js - tiny (1kb) javascript library for real-time currency conversion">money.js</a> does all this for you, in just over 1kb.</p>


			<h4 id="javascript-examples">JavaScript usage examples</h4>
			
			<p>Coming soon...</p>



			<h3>Get the rates...</h3>

			<h4 id="javascript-ajax-jquery">JavaScript (AJAX / jQuery)</h4>

			<p>You can easily load the rates into an application or website with JavaScript using an <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX">AJAX</acronym> request. I recommend using jQuery because it'll save you a tonne of headaches, and statistically speaking, you're probably already using it in your page/app:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">// Use jQuery.ajax to get the latest exchange rates, with JSONP:
$.ajax({
    url: 'http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json',
    dataType: 'jsonp',
    success: function(json) {
        // Rates are in `json.rates`
        // Base currency (USD) is `json.base`
        // UNIX Timestamp when rates were collected is in `json.timestamp`
        
        // If you're using money.js, do this:
        fx.rates = json.rates;
        fx.base = json.base;
    }
});</pre>
			<p>Use of <acronym title="JSON with Padding">JSONP</acronym> is optional - jQuery will append a <code>callback</code> parameter to the URL, and the response will be <a href="http://openexchangerates.org/latest.json?callback=whoaYeahCrazyCallback" title="Example of wrapped data" target="_blank">wrapped</a>. This is to prevent access-control (CORS) issues and will save you some headaches in many cases, though for security it's not tip-top (actually, if security is a primary concern in your app, you should proxy the results on your own server to prevent 100% against <acronym title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</acronym> attacks. I don't think the free proxy will support HTTPS any time soon).</p>
			
			<p>The <code>success</code> callback is asynchronous - meaning that if you have code to be run straight away, which relies on the exchange rates being available, this code should be inside the callback. The rest of your program will keep on executing while that AJAX request is waiting.</p>



			<h4 id="javascript-bootstrapped">JavaScript (Bootstrapped)</h4>

			<p>To avoid using <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX">AJAX</acronym>, or in places where greater security is needed, you can 'bootstrap' the exchange rate data into the page, using a server-side language like PHP.</p>
			<p>The advantages of this method are that the exchange rate data is <em>immediately available</em> (instead of having to wait for an AJAX response) as well as greater security (prevention against <acronym title="Cross-Site Scripting">XSS</acronym> attacks.)</p>
			<p>You can do this in any server-side language, but the end result is to have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block in your HTML markup that contains the data, accessible to JavaScript, as shown here. Note that this example is for a website/app using money.js, but you could easily replace <code>fx.rates</code> and <code>fx.base</code> with your own variables:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;script&gt;
    fx.rates = {"AED":3.6731,"AFN":43.330002,/* ... */"ZWL":322.355011};
    fx.base = "USD";
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

			<p>See the <a href="#php-curl" title="PHP (CURL)">PHP / CURL</a> section for an example of how this is done in PHP - the logic is exactly the same in whichever backend language you're using.</p>


			<h4 id="nodejs-npm">nodeJS (<em>npm</em> module)</h4>

			<p>If you want to load the rates in nodeJS, I made a handy <code>npm</code> module that can be installed with <strong>`<code>npm install exchange-rates</code>`</strong>. It will make a request using <em>http-agent</em> to fetch the data, then fire a continuation (callback) once they are available. Usage is pretty simple:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">// Example usage with money.js, loading data from the openexchangerates.org API:
var fx = require('money');
var exchange = require('exchange-rates');

// Fire the load function:
exchange.load(function(error, data) {
    // Check it worked:
    if ( error ) throw error;

    // Apply exchange rates and base rate to money.js `fx` object:
    fx.rates = data.rates;
    fx.base = data.base;

    // This should now work
    console.log('ten dollar? ' + fx(10).from('USD').to('GBP').toFixed(2));
    
    // NB: use of money.js is optional - use the rates however you like.
});</pre>
			<p>You can also access historical data by setting the first <code>url</code> argument like so:</p>
			
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">// Load historical data:
var exchange = require('exchange-rates');

exchange.load('http://openexchangerates.org/historical/2006-02-16.json', function(error, data) {
    // etc...
});</pre>

			<p>NB: the <em>exchange-rates</em> <code>npm</code> module is not restricted to loading from the default openexchangerates.org proxy - you can use it to load data from anywhere, and define your own <code>exchange.parse</code> function to parse different types of data.</p>


			<h4 id="nodejs-httpagent">nodeJS (httpAgent)</h4>

			<p>If you don't want to use the <code>npm</code> module, you can use a simple <em>http-agent</em> to grab the data.</p>
			<p>Example coming soon...</p>


			<h4 id="php-curl">PHP (CURL)</h4>

			<p>If you want to use the exchange rates in PHP, you can easily access the API with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php" title="CURL" target="_blank">CURL</a>, using something like this:</p>
			
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-php">&lt;?php
// Required file, could be e.g. '/historical/2011-01-01.json' or 'currencies.json'
$filename = 'latest.json';

// Open CURL session:
$ch = curl_init('http://openexchangerates.org/' . $filename);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

// Get the data:
$json = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

// Decode JSON response:
$exchangeRates = json_decode($json);

// You can now access the rates inside the parsed object, like so:
printf(
    &quot;1 %s in GBP: %s (as of %s)&quot;,
    $exchangeRates-&gt;base,
    $exchangeRates-&gt;rates-&gt;GBP,
    date('h:i jS F, Y', $exchangeRates-&gt;timestamp)
);
// -&gt; eg. &quot;1 USD in GBP: 0.643749 (as of 11:01, 3rd January 2012)&quot;</pre>

			<p>You can use PHP to 'bootstrap' the rates into JavaScript for client-side access (see the <a href="#javascript-bootstrapped" title="JavaScript (Bootstrapped)">JavaScript / Bootstrapped</a> section to see why you might want to do this). This example assumes you're using money.js, but you can simply replace <code>fx.rates</code> and <code>fx.base</code> with your own variables:</p>
			<pre class="prettyprint lang-php">// Bootstrap the rates into JavaScript for money.js:
echo '&lt;script&gt;fx.rates = ' . json_encode($exchangeRates->rates) . '; fx.base = ' . json_encode($exchangeRates->base) . '&lt;/script&gt;';</pre>
